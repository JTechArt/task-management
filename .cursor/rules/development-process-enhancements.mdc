# Development Process Enhancements

## Overview
These rules establish enhanced development processes integrating visual mockups, automated quality gates, and improved collaboration workflows for all AiTask application development.

## Visual Mockup Generation Requirements

### When to Generate Mockups
- **MANDATORY for UI Changes**: Any task involving new user interface components or screens
- **MANDATORY for Workflow Changes**: Tasks that modify how users interact with the system
- **MANDATORY for Dashboard/Reporting**: Any new metrics, charts, or data visualization
- **MANDATORY for Forms/Inputs**: New forms, input fields, or data entry workflows

### Mockup Types Required
1. **Interactive HTML Prototypes**: For complex user workflows and multi-step processes
2. **Static Visual Mockups**: For initial concept validation and stakeholder presentations
3. **Component Library Mockups**: For reusable UI components

### Quality Standards for Mockups
- **Realistic Content**: Use meaningful dummy data, not placeholder text
- **Responsive Design**: Show behavior across mobile, tablet, and desktop
- **Interaction States**: Include loading, error, and success states
- **Accessibility**: Follow WCAG 2.1 AA standards
- **Performance**: Mockups must load quickly and be responsive

## Enhanced 4-Phase Development Workflow

### Phase 1: Requirements and Visual Planning
1. **Task Analysis**: Understand business requirements and UI implications
2. **Mockup Generation**: Create appropriate visual mockups using the mockup services
3. **Stakeholder Review**: Present mockups for approval before development
4. **Technical Architecture**: Design approach with mockup references

### Phase 2: Implementation with Visual Reference
1. **Mockup-Driven Development**: Implement features following approved mockups exactly
2. **Concurrent Testing**: Write tests while developing, with 80%+ coverage
3. **Code Review**: At least two peer reviewers for significant changes
4. **Quality Gates**: All automated tests must pass before proceeding

### Phase 3: Validation Against Mockups
1. **Mockup Compliance Testing**: Validate implementation matches approved mockups
2. **E2E Testing**: Test all user workflows shown in mockups
3. **Cross-browser Testing**: Ensure compatibility across different browsers
4. **Performance Testing**: Meet benchmarks (3s load time, responsive interactions)

### Phase 4: Documentation and Completion
1. **Feature Documentation**: Include mockups in final documentation
2. **User Guides**: Use mockups for training materials
3. **Completion Verification**: Mark task complete only after verification
4. **Archive and Knowledge Sharing**: Move to completed folder and update docs

## Quality Gates (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### Code Quality Standards
- **Test Coverage**: Minimum 80% code coverage required
- **TypeScript**: Strict mode with comprehensive typing
- **Linting**: All ESLint/TSLint checks must pass
- **Security**: No critical vulnerabilities allowed

### Performance Standards
- **Load Time**: Pages must load within 3 seconds
- **Interaction Response**: UI interactions must respond within 200ms
- **Bundle Optimization**: Code-split and optimized bundles
- **Memory Management**: No memory leaks

### Accessibility Standards
- **WCAG 2.1 AA**: Minimum compliance level required
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard accessibility
- **Screen Reader**: Proper semantic markup and ARIA labels
- **Color Contrast**: Sufficient contrast ratios

## Mockup Service Integration

### API Usage Requirements
- Use `generate-visual-mockup` for static mockups and prototypes
- Use `generate-html-prototype` for interactive demonstrations
- Use `generate-rule` for creating custom development standards
- Always specify appropriate output formats and layout hints

### File Organization
- Store mockups in task-specific folders under `doc/tasks/{task-name}/`
- Use descriptive filenames: `mockup-{feature-name}.html`
- Include mockups in task documentation and completion reports

## Documentation Requirements

### Mandatory Documentation
- **Task Documentation**: Include mockups in task.md files
- **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger specs for endpoints
- **Component Documentation**: Storybook docs for UI components
- **User Guides**: Include mockup screenshots and workflows

### Visual Documentation Standards
- **Mockup Integration**: Embed mockups in all feature documentation
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Show different states and scenarios
- **Cross-referencing**: Link mockups to implementation code
- **Version Control**: Track mockup changes and iterations

## Collaboration and Communication

### Stakeholder Communication
- **Visual Presentations**: Use mockups for all stakeholder demos
- **Approval Workflows**: Require explicit approval on mockups before coding
- **Feedback Collection**: Structured feedback on visual specifications
- **Change Management**: Visual diff for scope changes

### Team Collaboration
- **Cross-functional Reviews**: Include design, dev, product, and QA
- **Mockup Reviews**: Regular review sessions for mockup quality
- **Knowledge Sharing**: Share mockup best practices across teams
- **Tool Training**: Ensure team knows how to use mockup services

## Failure Prevention

### Common Pitfalls to Avoid
- **Late Mockup Creation**: Never start development without approved mockups
- **Insufficient Detail**: Mockups must show all interaction states
- **Skipping Reviews**: All mockups require stakeholder approval
- **Implementation Drift**: Final implementation must match approved mockups exactly

### Quality Checkpoints
- **Pre-development**: Mockups approved by stakeholders
- **Mid-development**: Implementation matches mockup specifications
- **Pre-completion**: All mockup scenarios tested and validated
- **Post-completion**: Documentation includes mockups and is complete

## Continuous Improvement

### Metrics and Monitoring
- **Mockup Approval Rate**: Track first-time approval percentage
- **Implementation Accuracy**: Measure mockup-to-code fidelity
- **User Satisfaction**: Collect feedback on delivered features
- **Process Efficiency**: Monitor time from mockup to delivery

### Regular Process Review
- **Monthly Reviews**: Assess process effectiveness and issues
- **Tool Improvement**: Enhance mockup generation capabilities
- **Training Updates**: Keep team skills current with new tools
- **Best Practice Evolution**: Continuously refine standards

## Success Criteria

### Project-Level Success
- **90%+ Mockup Approval Rate**: High first-time approval on mockups
- **95%+ Implementation Accuracy**: Implementation matches approved mockups
- **Zero Critical Bugs**: No critical issues in delivered features
- **Improved Velocity**: Faster development with clearer specifications

### Quality Assurance
- **100% Rule Compliance**: All development follows these standards
- **Complete Documentation**: All features have comprehensive docs with mockups
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: High satisfaction with delivered features
- **Team Efficiency**: Reduced rework and clarification meetings

This enhanced development process is MANDATORY for all new features and significant changes to ensure consistent quality, clear communication, and successful delivery.
